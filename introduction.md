The maps and images on these pages are designed to illustrate the global and regional patterns of some fundamental climate variables such as temperature and precipitation, and their energy- and water-balance controls.  The global data plotted here are from the ECMWF fifth-generation ERA5 Reanalysis:  [[ERA5 monthly averaged data on pressure levels from 1979 to present]](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels-monthly-means) and [[ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present]](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means) -- see the acknowledgments tab for details.  

The animations and maps are organized in a general cause-and-effect order, beginning with the external energy inputs to the climate system, and ending with precipitation and the surface water balance, e.g.:

- Global energy balance
- Temperature
- Atmospheric circulation and winds
- Atmospheric moisture and energy fluxes
- Globe water balance/precipitation/snow

There are also animations of temperature and precipitation for North America and the coterminous United States (CONUS).
